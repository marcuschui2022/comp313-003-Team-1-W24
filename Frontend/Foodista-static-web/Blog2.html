        <p>Adapting to the latest bakery trends
        BakeAway’s Doug Hall explains how the bake-at-home manufacturer has adapted its product range to suit consumer needs.
        It’s no secret that the UK food and drink industry has seen unprecedented changes in recent years. Lockdown, 
        the introduction of High Fat Salt and Sugar (HFSS) restrictions and the current cost-of-living crisis have forced key industry players, such as BakeAway, to adapt as it looks to future-proof its growth.
        </p>
         <p>BakeAway is a UK manufacturer creating a range of bake-at-home products, including pastry, dough and pancakes, both for their own pancake brands, licensed products and private label. 
            Here, the manufacturer explains the main drivers in its sector at present and explains how it is adapting to meet current consumer trends.</p>   
         <p>With stricter regulations still to be imposed in October 2023 – there will be limited opportunity for HFSS products bought through volume promotions, 
            such as ‘buy one get one free’ offers, major snacking manufacturers have been scrambling to develop new products to bypass the laws.
        </p>   
        <p>BakeAway has revealed how the recent law changes have impacted its business and inspired its NPD plans. BakeAway’s recent NPD has included the launch of OaYeah! pancakes, made from an oat-based drink which contains less saturated fat and sugar than cow’s milk chilled pancakes. Data shows that oat milk is the UK consumers number one choice of dairy-free milk alternative.</p>
        <p>“We know that consumers want reduced fat, salt and sugar options when shopping for themselves and their families, but they do not want to compromise on taste or stray too far from their weekly shopping budget,” said Jennie Bosson, Marketing Manager at BakeAway.</p>
        <p>“This insight was key to the development of our latest product launch, OaYeah!, our HFSS-compliant ready-made, dairy-free pancake brand.</p>
        <p>“According to the Bloomberg Intelligence Report, plant-based food sales are expected to increase fivefold by 2030. Our own insights – which helped inform our new product development with OaYeah! – reflect this trend, with more consumers looking for products with additional benefits, such as plant-based milk and protein enhancements. Consumer insights will continue to shape the future of BakeAway and inform our innovations moving forwards.”</p>
