        <p>I think it’s time to break up with your toaster.</p>
         <p>This is easy for me to say: I don’t have one and haven’t for over a decade. Counter space is precious around these parts, and though my adolescence was full of Eggo waffles, I no longer require the services of bulky, single-task appliances such as the four-slice toaster I grew up using. It’s not that I’ve given up toast—in fact, I may be eating more of it than ever before. I’ve simply changed my technique. Now I’m all about pan-frying my bread in oil, creating a delightfully crispy, mildly indulgent base for whatever else I want to eat. One bite and you might find yourself wrapping up your toaster cord for the very last time.

         </p>   
         <p>What makes fried bread so (SO) much better than the regular stuff? It’s the perfect storm of rich flavor, next-level crispiness, and adaptability. I’d go so far as to say that toast prepared this way shouldn’t even be called toast, since it’s so wildly different is it from the typical breakfast carb. If you’re on the fence about giving it a shot, allow me to detail fried bread's many assets, in an effort to convince you to kick your toaster to the curb.</p>
        <h3>It’s easy.</h3>
        <p>Okay, so the process is a bit more involved than inserting slices into a slot and pressing a button. But for the added flavor and texture bump, it’s only a few extra minutes of effort. </p>

        <p>Just heat a few glugs of your choice of oil (more on that shortly) in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add your bread. I like to rub my slice in the oil on one side just to coat, then immediately flip it over to fry thoroughly on the other side before flipping back to finish; this ensures that the second side is already glistening and ready to go, so you won’t need to add any extra oil. Once your toast is crisp and golden brown, transfer it to a plate and immediately season with a bit of salt before loading it up with the toppings of your choice.</p>
        <h3>It’s flavorful.</h3>
        <p>Unlike the dry toast you can make in a toaster (or under the broiler in your oven), slices fried in oil are rich and luxurious; that bit of extra fat goes a long way in the flavor department. But you can take your toast in a more specific taste direction by switching up the oil you use. I love coconut and sesame oil for crisping bread, especially when the toppings I’m planning to use go particularly well with those flavors. Coconut oil’s creamy, distinctive notes are delightful under a scoop of dal, while sesame oil adds a nuttiness to a banh mi-inspired slice with plenty of mayo. Try avocado oil, peanut oil, sunflower seed oil, or ghee, which makes a delightful toast that I could eat topped with leftover saag every single day.</p>
