        <center><h2>How Baking Soda Really Works</h2></center>
        <center><img src="content/pics/BakingSoda.png" class="card-img-top img-fluid" alt="..." width="600" height="380"/></center>
        <p>The funny thing about baking soda is that there are approximately a gazillion uses for it besides the singular usage spelled out in its very name.</p>
         <p>It’s remarkable that the stuff hasn’t been renamed “everything soda.” After all, the Egyptians were using a baking soda–like substance back in B.C. times to mummify their dead. Today, it’s no secret that sodium bicarbonate—the chemical composition of baking soda—has powerful cleaning, scouring, and deodorizing qualities. You can use it to shine up your sink or your silver jewelry; freshen your laundry; rinse away pesticide residue from produce or clean garlicky flavors from wooden chopping boards. And, of course, who doesn’t have a blaze orange Arm & Hammer box of undetermined vintage cracked open in the farthest reaches of their refrigerator? Over the years, entire books have been devoted to the multi-category wonders of baking soda: natural cleaning, health remedies, and more. But not all recommendations are equal.</p>   
         <p>For all the wonders of baking soda, some of its purported uses are best avoided (you can wreck your skin’s natural barrier, for example, by using it as an exfoliator). Even for many baking recipes, it’s not the ideal leavener to use, while it actually is the right box to grab for all sorts of other cooking tricks. To find out what exactly baking soda does and when to use it, I called up two scientist-cookbook authors: Nik Sharma, a molecular biologist and the author of the Flavor Equation, and Shirley Corriher, a biochemist and the author of KitchenWise.</p>
