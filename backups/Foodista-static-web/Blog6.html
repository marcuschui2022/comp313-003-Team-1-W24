        <p>If cooking were a video game, using nonstick pans would be like playing on easy mode. The best nonstick pans are some of the most forgiving kitchen tools you can use. Do you happen to struggle a little with sautéing and stir-frying? Nonstick will minimize any burnt, cruddy mishaps. Are you scarred by pancake fails of years past? Nonstick pans practically do all the work for you.</p>
         <p>Any individual who feels that their cooking skills are, shall we say, under-seasoned, will benefit from having a nonstick pan in their arsenal. However, it’s a good idea to not rely on them for too long. Nonstick coatings do not last forever; a pan’s lifespan can vary depend on the type of nonstick coating but you can expect pretty much all of them to lose their flawless glide after a couple of years. Yes, even the pans boasting (limited) lifetime warranties. We hate to say it, but these pans, are disposable by design, which is why we suggest thinking a little before buying that appealing direct-to-consumer nonstick cookware set (and if you must go the pan set route, keep it to stainless steel).</p>   
         <p>That being said, we understand that there are many home cooks out there who just want to make dinner on easy mode, and not have to stress too much about technique and clean up. We aren’t immune to the nonstick pan’s charms either. Especially when cooking eggs in dishes like like crepes, omelets, and frittatas, nonstick properties are an undeniable boon.</p>
