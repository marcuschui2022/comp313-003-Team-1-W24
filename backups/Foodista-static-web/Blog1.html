            <p>Cooking with fish can be more challenging than other types of meats thanks to its tendency to break apart during the process. Grilling fish over a bed of freshly sliced citrus can solve the delicacy problem—not to mention adding some serious flavor to your finished dish.

                There are three major benefits to barbecuing your fish on top of citrus:
                
                Grilling your fish over citrus can improve the taste by neutralizing some of the less desirable flavors of fish, as well as adding the zesty brightness citrus fruits are renowned for.
                Citrus slices add an eye-pleasing pop of color that makes your food look wonderful, both on the grill and on the plate.
                Most importantly, the citrus slices prevent the fish from sticking to the grill grates—something fish is prone to do.

                <p><h3>How To Grill Your Fish Over Citrus</p></h3>
                
                <p>Follow these steps for how to grill fish over citrus:</p>
                
                1. Coat your fish fillets or steaks with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.<br>
                2. Slice your citrus of choice a quarter inch thick.<br>
                3. Layer citrus slices directly onto your grill grates, or onto a wood plank or piece of slate. Alternately, place them into a basket to hold everything in place and make flipping easier.<br>
                4. Place your fish directly on top of the citrus slices.<br>
                5. Get cooking! Grill time will depend on the type of fish and the thickness of the cut. If you are using fillets or steaks, cooking time is typically around 3-4 minutes per side, but you don’t have to flip when grilling fish over citrus. If you opt to skip the flip, plan for 7-8 minutes cooking time. Whole fish will take longer to grill and do need to be flipped. 7-8 minutes per side is usually sufficient.<br>
                
                <p><h4>Types of citrus to try:</p></h4>
                
                <p>Different citrus offers different flavors to play with, and many of them pair well with a variety of fish. Lemon and salmon is a popular combo, but don’t be afraid to consider trying a variety of different citrus, including:</p>

                <li>Meyer Lemon (Meyer lemons are less tart and have a thinner skin than a regular lemon)</li>
                <li>Lime</li>
                <li>Orange</li>
                <li>Yuzu Lemon (Yuzu lemons are more sour than a regular lemon, but with floral and herbal notes)</li>
                <li>Pink Grapefruit</li>
                <li>Pomelo</li>
                <p>You may also want to consider pairing the citrus slices with fresh herbs for a little extra flavor, such as basil, cilantro, dill (a classic with lemon and salmon), or rosemary.</p>
