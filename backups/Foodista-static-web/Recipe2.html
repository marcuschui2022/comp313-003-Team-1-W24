                <p><h3>Ingredients</p></h3>
                
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
                
                <li>16 large shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails on, or more to taste</li>

                <li>3 large cloves garlic, smashed, or more to taste</li>    

                <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>

                <li>2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or to taste</li>

                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

                <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice/li>

                <li>3 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
                
                
                <p><h3>Directions</p></h3>

                <p><h4>Step 1:</p></h3>
                Gather all ingredients.</br>
                <p><h4>Step 2:</p></h3>       
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat until warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Add shrimp, garlic, and pepper flakes all at once and stir together. Add seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper and mix until combined.</br>
                <p><h4>Step 3:</p></h3>       
                Cook and stir until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 3 to 5 minutes.</br>
                <p><h4>Step 4:</p></h3>
                Reduce heat to medium and melt butter in the pan juices, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add honey, water, and vinegar. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally until sauce has reduced down and slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Return pork back to the skillet and baste generously with the sauce.</br>
